# etch-a-sketch

-Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
-Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
-It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).

There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Feel free to use any or play with each of them:
float/clear
inline-block
flexbox
CSS Grid

-Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
-adding a new class to the div.
-changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.
